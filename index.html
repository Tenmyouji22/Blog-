            <h2>Personality</h2>
            <p>According to the 999 novelization, Junpei is a rather ordinary and unremarkable guy who is almost done with college. He lacks a job and employment prospects. He hasn't experienced much failure or setbacks in his life. He did not oppose the adults around him; he'd gone through life doing as they said and going with the flow - a good little boy, never really asking any questions. </p>

            <h2>Development</h2>
            <p>After the Second Nonary Game, Junpei became cynical and says he's "done with playing the action hero" because he "grew up". This is a result of the second Nonary Game and disappointment from looking for Akane to no avail.</p>

            <p> From the very beginning though, he trusted Quark completely as, revealed later, Quark became his adopted grandson. He was very strict raising Quark because he wanted Quark to be strong enough to live on his own.</p>
